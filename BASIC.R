x <- 10
y <- 5
z <- x + y
print(z)
# This code initializes two variables, x and y, with values 10 and 5 respectively,
# then calculates their sum and stores it in variable z, which is printed to the console.
MODEL <- ('HELLO WORLD')
typeof(MODEL)
# This code assigns the string 'HELLO WORLD' to the variable MODEL and checks its type,
# which should return "character" since MODEL is a string.
